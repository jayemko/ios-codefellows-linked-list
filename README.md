Write a LinkedList class in Objective-C
=======================================

(Note that you'll have to have a Node class as well.) Your LinkedList class should have methods for:

Inserting a new node, given a value for that node.
Deleting a node by value.
Bonus: Display a LinkedList in a UITableView.
